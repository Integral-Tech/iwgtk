# TODO

Notifications and error messages:
 * Review all notification/error messages and make them more consistent.
 * Allow users to select which messages to show.
 * Display the SSID of the network in the "connected" and "disconnected" messages.
 * Show a message when a device is added/removed.

Remember the SSID of a newly created AP or ad-hoc node and display it while the AP/node is running.
